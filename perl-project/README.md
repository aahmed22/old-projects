This is a three-part project that manipulates three text files called solar.txt, electricity.txt and
random.txt respectively. The purpose of this project was to use perl built-in support for pattern
matching.

Part1 output is displayed via console. Part2 and Part3 are stored in external text files.

Enjoy! :satisfied:
