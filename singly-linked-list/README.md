The purpose of this project was to include additional
functionality to an existing linked list class.

The following member functions were added:

- reverse()
- multiply(value)
- frequency(value)
- listCount()
- sortList(value)
- deleteAll()
- appendList(value)
- removeNodes(value, value)

Have fun! :grin:
